 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The following code documentation is a set of tipps and diagramms as well as function and structure descriptions
 * which help when using the library. It is used to increase the implementation speed. Some examples are attached
 * in this documentation as well
 *
 * \section install_sec Static compile flags
 *
 * LIBL6474_STEP_ASYNC:
 * This DEFINE is used to switch from blocking synchronous mode to asynchronous non-blocking step mode. 
 * This changes the API behavior
 * 
 * LIBL6474_HAS_LOCKING:
 * This DEFINE is used to enable the lock guard and thread synchronization guard abstraction,
 * which requires additional abstraction functions
 *
 * LIBL6474_DISABLE_OCD:
 * Should only be used for debugging purpopses and not for productive code!
 * This DEFINE is used to disable the overcurrent detection feature in the library and the stepper driver
 * 
 * LIBL6474_HAS_FLAG:
 * enables the support of the flag pin
 * This DEFINE is used to enable the FLAG pin support, which requires additional abstraction functions
 *
 * \section state_sec State diagram 
 * The following state diagram shows the internal state machine handling which follows or represents the
 * state of the stepper driver chip. The fault conditions are not depicted in the diagram but in all regular
 * cases the error hendling is done by resetting and reinitialization of the stepper driver by the library.

 * \section state_example Examples
 * The following example shows a part of the abstraction functions which are required
 * for the usage of the Stepper library. It also shows how to create a instance of
 * the stepper library.
 * \code
 * static void* StepLibraryMalloc( unsigned int size )
 * {
 * 	 return malloc(size);
 * }
 * 
 * static void StepLibraryFree( const void* const ptr )
 * {
 * 	 free((void*)ptr);
 * }
 * 
 * static int StepDriverSpiTransfer( void* pIO, char* pRX, const char* pTX, unsigned int length )
 * {
 *   // byte based access, so keep in mind that only single byte transfers are performed!
 *   for ( unsigned int i = 0; i < length; i++ )
 *   {
 *     ...
 *   }
 *   return 0;
 * }
 * 
 * ...
 * 
 * // pass all function pointers required by the stepper library
 * // to a separate platform abstraction structure
 * L6474x_Platform_t p;
 * p.malloc     = StepLibraryMalloc;
 * p.free       = StepLibraryFree;
 * p.transfer   = StepDriverSpiTransfer;
 * p.reset      = StepDriverReset;
 * p.sleep      = StepLibraryDelay;
 * p.stepAsync  = StepTimerAsync;
 * p.cancelStep = StepTimerCancelAsync;
 * 
 * // now create the handle
 * L6474_Handle_t h = L6474_CreateInstance(&p, null, null, null); 
 * \endcode
 * 
 * The following example shows a really simple instantiation and usage
 * of the library with a simple default and straight forward configuration
 * and no calculation of any step widths or resolutions
 * 
 * \code
 * 
 * ...
 * 
 * int result = 0;
 * ...
 * 
 * // reset all and take all initialization steps
 * result |= L6474_ResetStandBy(h);
 * result |= L6474_Initialize(h, &param);
 * result |= L6474_SetPowerOutputs(h, 1);
 * 
 * ...
 * 
 * // in case we have no error, we can enable the drivers
 * // and then we step a bit
 * if ( result == 0 )
 * {
 *     result |= L6474_StepIncremental(h, 1000 );
 * }
 * else
 * {
 *	   // error handling
 *     ...
 * }

 * \page lib_port_page Library porting
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The library is written with a minimum set of compiler dependencies to make it portable on most toolchains
 * and most compilers which are able to compile C. There are no GCC attributes or MSVC pragmas included in the code
 * furthermore there are no weak functions or other non ISO-C language keywords which are not parsable from
 * all compilers. To include the library in a project, the following page helps to do the job and can be used as
 * a step by step quick porting guide.
 *
 * \section step_by_step_sec required steps to include the library
 * -# include all include paths of the library folder (inc-folder) to your project or copy them into your project as needed
 * -# link all C files (src-folder) to your project or copy them to your project as needed
 * -# adapt your makefile in case you have one. When using eclipse project this is not required
 * -# copy the template header LibL6474Config.h file to your project or create your own and adapt the compile time parameters as needed.
 * -# compile the source code once to make sure everything builds without issues and your include paths are correct.
 * -# now implement the platform functions which are required be the L6474x_Platform_t structure when calling L6474_CreateInstance.
 * -# when all functions are defined, no error should be returned after the call of L6474_CreateInstance. Porting is done.
